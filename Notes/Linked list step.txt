Step:

Define the struct

Declare the stack variables

Allocate the dynamic memory of linked list in heap

Link 1st And 2nd Node 
Link 2nd And 3rd Node
Terminate the list at the third node


Called linkedListTraversal Function

STEP 2:

Linked List Insertion:

CASE 1: Insert at the beginning
CASE 2: Insert in between
CASE 3: Insert at the end
CASE 4: Insert after a Node
